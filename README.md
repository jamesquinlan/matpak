# matpak
matpak stands for "MATrix PAcKage".  It is a collection of utility functions written in MATLAB for matrix manipulation and analysis.  It contains a several *is* functions to classify matrices (e.g., ism(A) determines if a matrix is an M-matrix).    

MATLAB Version: 9.8.0.1323502 (R2020a)


## Contents in brief

* ism(A) - determines if a matrix is an M-matrix
